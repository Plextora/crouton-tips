                                which is slowly becoming more and more out of date.</p>

                            <!-- Bionic Beaver Stuff -->
                            <p>If you try installing Bionic Beaver normally like this:
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p> </p>
                                <p style="padding: 10px; border: 2px solid green;">sudo crouton -r bionic -t xfce</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>you'll run into errors before you even get to create a new user. And you can't rerun the script. You have to delete the chroot and start all over again. The reason why the errors occurs seems to be becasue the package <strong>xserver-xorg-video-all</strong>                                    never gets installed. So in order to fix this error, we'll need to install the barebones of a chroot:
                                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p> </p>
                                    <p style="padding: 10px; border: 2px solid green;">sudo crouton -r bionic -t core,audio,cli-extra</p>
                                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>This will install a base linux system with CLI. Then after creating a user, do this command:
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    </p>
                                    <p style="padding: 10px; border: 2px solid green;">sudo enter-chroot</p>
                                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>and then this one:</p>
                                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p style="padding: 10px; border: 2px solid green;">sudo apt-get install xterm xinit</p>
                                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>which will install the <strong>xserver-xorg-video-all</strong> package. Now, finish your setup with something like:</p>
                                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p style="padding: 10px; border: 2px solid green;">sudo crouton -n bionic -t x11,xorg,extension,keyboard,xfce -u</p>
                                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>And now you have a Bionic Beaver chroot!</p>
                                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                            <p>ChromeOS runs alot of Chrome processes. If you primarily use your chroot, use the -b command whenever you boot Crouton, and find Crouton very sluggish, this might be the fix for you! It kills alot of Chrome processes without breaking anything,</p><h4><strong>But any unsaved work will be lost!</strong></h4><p>Just copy paste the command below into your Linux Terminal.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p style="padding: 10px; border: 2px solid green;">ps ax -o sess,pgrp,pid,cmd | awk '$4 ~ /\/chrome$/ { print $3 }' | xargs $nodo kill</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Currently on Chrome OS version 92, if you switch back to Chrome OS your Chromebook might freeze and open Chrome back open again, if this happens and you want them killed again just simply switch back to Crouton and run the command listed above again.</p>

                            <h2><strong>How to control audio volume in Crouton</strong></h2>
                            <p>If you don't want to switch back to Chrome OS every time you want to turn up/down the volume, there's a fix for this!</p>
                            <p>Crouton has a way to turn up/down the volume within your chroot without having to always switch to Chrome OS, and it affects Chrome OS as well so audio is synced between the two! All you have to do is go into your Linux terminal and copy paste this in:</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p style="padding: 10px; border: 2px solid green;">alsamixer</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Then, you'll get a gui with a big vertical volume bar. You can use number keys 1-9 to quickly jump volume values (for example, pressing 1 goes to 10, 5 goes to 50, etc.) or you can use the arrow keys to go to more precise values. I recommend to keep the terminal open for quick volume changes. If you decide to keep your volume and not have it open, just simply close the terminal.</p>
